          is a cellular automaton that takes place 2D grid, where each cell is
          either Alive or Dead. After each generation, each square counts how
          many Alive neighbours it has, and if:

        <h2>Developer Notes and Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest lesson for me is, just because you can use a
          library/framework to build something doesn't mean you should (in this
          project, React)üòÖ. Also to research the right tools for the job before
          you build anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I originally built the grid in React by rendering div's as the grid
          but it was not performant at all. I researched, and decided a normal
          HTML canvas was the way to go. I settled on the{" "}
          <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">
            p5
          </a>{" "}
          library to render the canvas with JS and used it as an instance
          instead of globally to allow React to play nicely with it.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The state structure is a two dimentional array (array of arrays) for
          rows and nested objects for squares. Thus, when I built in React the
          first time I was revisiting past learnings about accidental state
          mutation and properly copying/updating nested objects in application
          state üòê. Yay.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned how to optimize performance; using the performance tab in
          google chrome I identified which function calls were slowest and
          improved them. Some examples are: not creating new arrays at each
          interval, more checks to see if each loop is actually necessary, and
          more efficiently counting neighbours.
