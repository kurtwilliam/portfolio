                The biggest lesson for me is, just because you can use a
                library/framework to build something doesn't mean you should (in
                this project, React)üòÖ. Also to research the right tools for the
                job before you build anything.

                I originally built the grid in React by rendering div's as the
                grid but it was not performant at all. I researched, and decided
                a normal HTML canvas was the way to go. I settled on the{" "}
                <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">
                  p5
                </a>{" "}
                library to render the canvas with JS and used it as an instance
                instead of globally to allow React to play nicely with it.{" "}

                The state structure is a two dimentional array (array of arrays)
                for rows and nested objects for squares. Thus, when I built in
                React the first time I was revisiting past learnings about
                accidental state mutation and properly copying/updating nested
                objects in application state üòê. Yay.

              <p>
                I learned how to optimize performance; using the performance tab
                in google chrome I identified which function calls were slowest
                and improved them. Some examples are: not creating new arrays at
                each interval, more checks to see if each loop is actually
                necessary, and more efficiently counting neighbours.
