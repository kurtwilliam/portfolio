              <h2>Notes and Learnings</h2>
              <p>Designed by Devin, built by Kurt.</p>
              <p>
                Built using React, p5.js, and Styled-Components, but Vanilla
                JavaScript, HTML and CSS would have been fine. Doesn't use React
                hooks (because I couldn't update React versions without wifi
                when initially building)
              </p>
              <p>
                Just because you can use a library/framework to build something
                doesn't mean you should. In the future I will research the right
                tools for the job before building anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                The grid was originally built in React by rendering div's as the
                grid, but performance was terrible. After research I decided a
                normal HTML canvas was the way to go. I settled on the{" "}
                <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">
                  p5
                </a>{" "}
                library to render the canvas with JS and used it as an instance
                instead of globally to allow React to play nicely with it.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                The grid state structure is a two dimentional array (array of
                arrays) for rows and nested objects for squares. Thus, when I
                built it in React the first time I was revisiting past learnings
                about accidental state mutation and properly copying/updating
                nested objects in application state üòê. Yay.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned how to optimize performance; using the performance tab
                in google chrome I identified which function calls were slowest
                and improved them. Some improvements were: not creating new
                arrays on each interval, more checks to see if each loop is
                actually necessary, and more efficiently counting neighbouring
                cells.
